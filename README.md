# Hello again everyone ðŸ˜‰

Here's my another scope of work [**Currency converter** - feel free to check it out :)](https://woytekmig.github.io/currencyConverter/)

It shows how I practise skills in: 
- [x] **HTML** (BEM convention)
- [x] **CSS** (BEM convention)
  and especially in: 
- [x] **JS** (ES6)

which I've learn recent weeks, during YouCode programmig course  :) Here's a little demo :

The main challenge was to implement code which let convert PLN to some other currency. I decided to extend this task, and let convert four currencies (PLN, EUR, GBP and USD) in any combination you want :) Then, even bigger challenge was to simplify that code, by using functions. I hope, I did pretty well... ;) You can tell me ! :)
